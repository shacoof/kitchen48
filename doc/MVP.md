# Background
I want to develop a cooking application. 
The MVP will be in a browser but down the road I might have android and iphone versions of it so the architecture needs to separate clearly between backend functionality and frontend. 
For browser experince I will use react. 
The applicaiton will have many modules and I want each module to live in a separate folder so that working in parallel on multiple modules will have small risk of collision
System architecture should support growth, have a clean separate DB layer that will allow me easily switch between databases, be GenAI friendly, i.e. clean module structure to allow multiple agents to run with low chance of collision. 
The MVP will be the "under construction page"
